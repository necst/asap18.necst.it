          <h2>Welcome to ASAP-2018!</h2>
          <p>
            The 29th IEEE International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors 2018 takes place in Milan, Italy. The 2018 edition of the conference is organized by Politecnico di Milano.
          </p>

          <p>
            The history of the event traces back to the International Workshop on Systolic Arrays, organized in 1986 in Oxford, UK. It later developed into the International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors. With its current title, it was organized for the first time in Chicago, USA in 1996. Since then it has alternated between Europe and North-America.

            The conference will cover the theory and practice of application-specific systems, architectures and processors. The 2018 conference will build upon traditional strengths in areas such as computer arithmetic, cryptography, compression, signal and image processing, network processing, reconfigurable computing, application-specific instruction-set processors, and hardware accelerators. 
          </p>
