            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
                Reinforcement learning, particularly if enhanced by deep networks, is now more than ever mainstream research.
                I will go through a very basic overview of reinforcement learning, to focus on financial applications and eventually discuss the concept of algorithmic risk.
